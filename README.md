# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the chance of heart disease using data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.  
It’s a complete machine learning workflow — from cleaning the raw data to training and improving the final model.

## 📊 What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** model  
- Evaluated and improved the accuracy  
- Saved the trained model for future use

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Pickle

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install required libraries  
3. Open the notebook `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`  
4. Run all cells to see the full workflow

## 📈 Results
The model achieved around **79% accuracy**, with key features like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure playing major roles.
